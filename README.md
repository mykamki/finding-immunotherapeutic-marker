# Finding-immunotherapeutic-marker

This is the projecto to identify gene signature for efficiency of immune checkpoint blockage (ICB) in bladder cancer patients.

# Workflow
1. Detect subpopulation associated with overall survival of bladder cancer patients treated ICB
2. Find gene signature using DE analysis with others
3. Evaluate gene signature using other datasets
